The java tests included here do not occur in dieharder or TestU01.
To test eegl with dieharder or TestU01, feed the output from EeglGen
into those test suites.  The bit2raw program converts the output of
EeglGen into a format that the dieharder test can use.

The java version of eegl runs about 1000 times slower than
the C version, based on the timings in dieharder.

------------------------------------------------------

Test java eegl by running TstEegl.  There are no parameters.

java TstEegl

The output from TstEegl is a sample of the methods in
Eegl/Eegl.java.

------------------------------------------------------

EeglSum test.

There are no parameters.

java EeglSum

The output from tstsum.sh is a total of zero and one bits.
Each total should be approximately 500,000.

------------------------------------------------------

Chi square test.

There are no parameters.

java EeglChi

The output from tstchi.sh is a table of differences and
a chi square total.

If a test fails, repeat the test.  It should fail once in 10 tests
on average.

------------------------------------------------------

Dieharder Test:  tstdie.sh
Dieharder has to be installed first.

sudo apt-get install libdieharder-dev
sudo apt-get install dieharder

tstdie.sh illustrates a raw stream of random data piped into a
down stream test suite.

./tstdie.sh

The output from tstdie.sh is a statistical report.
This is a long running test.  To shorten the test, only the
birthday test is run with one p-value.

------------------------------------------------------

TestU01 is more difficult to run with the eegl generator.
You have to download the TestU01 package and then compile it.
Then you have to write and compile a test program in the
examples directory of TestU01.  The short guide for TestU01
gives you examples of how to set up a test.  In particular,
you need to use ufile to read input from eeglraw in your test.
After you get over the learning curve, you will be rewarded
with some strong and varied tests.
