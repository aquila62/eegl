This is the python version of the eegl random number generator.

To test eegl in python,

import eegl     # to use eegl methods

# the default number of states is 1000

The calling program is responsible for passing valid parameters
to the methods.

Methods:

eegl.eeglinit(eegl.states)    # to initialize the generator

eegl.eegl()            # to generate a random bit 0,1

eegl.eeglunif()        # to generate a random uniform number 0-1

eegl.eeglint(limit)    # to generate a random integer 0 up to limit

eegl.eeglpwr(bits)     # to generate a random 1-32 bit integer

Test programs:

tsteegl.py samples the methods.  Run it several times.

tstsum.sh counts number of zeros and ones in a sample of
1 million bits.

tstdie.sh feeds raw data to dieharder and runs a test. 
This test runs very slowly, so the simplest test was
chosen in dieharder, the birthday test with one p-value.
