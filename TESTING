Test eegl by running tsteegl.  There are no parameters.

./tsteegl

The output from tsteegl is a block of 1000 random bits.

------------------------------------------------------

Test eeglunif() and eeglint() by running tstnc.
This test requires the new curses package.
tstnc uses one parameter, the number of states in eegl.

./tstnc 1000

The output from tstnc is a random pattern of ASCII characters
on a curses screen.  To quit press 'q'.

------------------------------------------------------

Test eeglpwr() by running tstdots.
This test requires X Windows.
tstdots uses one parameter, the number of states in eegl.

./tstdots 1000

The output from tstdots is a random bitmap pattern of pixels 
on an X Windows screen.  To quit press 'q'.

------------------------------------------------------

Random Walk Test:  tstrwlk.sh.
tstrwlk.sh illustrates a random bit stream piped into a
down stream program.
This test requires X Windows.
tstrwlk.sh uses one parameter, the number of states in eegl.

./tstrwlk.sh 1000

The output from tstrwlk.sh is a random walk relative to a midpoint
line on an X Windows screen.  To quit press 'q'.

There is one system bug in this program that needs to be fixed.
eeglgen aborts when ranwlk ends.  This bug does not affect the
running of the test.  Only the ending of the program is not clean.
