The C++ tests included here do not occur in dieharder or
TestU01.  Dieharder and TestU01 have a statistical version of
the random walk test.  To test eegl with dieharder or TestU01,
feed the output from eeglraw into those test suites.

The C++ version of eegl runs about 12 times slower than
the C version, based on the timings in dieharder.

------------------------------------------------------

Test C++ eegl by running tsteegl.  There are no parameters.

./tsteegl

The output from tsteegl is a sample of the methods in
Eegl.cpp.

------------------------------------------------------

eegl chi square test.  There are no parameters.

./eeglchi

The output from tsteegl is a chi square report
The chi square test fails 10% of the time on average.

------------------------------------------------------

Random Walk Test:  tstwlk.sh
This test requires X Windows.

sudo apt-get install libx11-dev

tstwlk.sh illustrates an ASCII stream of random data piped into
a down stream test suite.  tstwlk.sh uses no parameter.  It is
compiled with 1000 states.

./tstwlk.sh

The output from tstwlk.sh is a random walk relative to a midpoint
line on an X Windows screen.  To quit press any key.

------------------------------------------------------

Dieharder Test:  tstdie.sh
Dieharder has to be installed first.

sudo apt-get install libdieharder-dev
sudo apt-get install dieharder

tstdie.sh illustrates a raw stream of random data piped into a
down stream test suite.

./tstdie.sh

The output from tstdie.sh is a statistical report.
This is a long running test.  To interrupt press CTRL-C.
The first test takes half minute to print a report.

------------------------------------------------------

TestU01 is more difficult to run with the eegl generator.
You have to download the TestU01 package and then compile it.
Then you have to write and compile a test program in the
examples directory of TestU01.  The short guide for TestU01
gives you examples of how to set up a test.  In particular,
you need to use ufile to read input from eeglraw in your test.
After you get over the learning curve, you will be rewarded
with some strong and varied tests.
